# This file sets up my needed language servers
# Using `coc.nvim` as my client as of 05/27/2019
# `coc.nvim` has various extensions which are based on VSCode extensions and
# can provide additional functionality on top of LSP (or use a different
# protocol entirely in the case of `coc-tsserver`, see note below)
#
# currently used languages:
#
# - ruby (kinda flaky server in limited testing)
# - typescript (`coc-tsserver` works well, though does not conform to LSP)
# - rust
# - bash
# - python
#
# note: Typescript language knowledge provided through the `coc-tsserver`
# extension which installs its own server that does not conform to the LSP (used
# in VSCode too, Microsoft forgoing it's own protocol for now, probably tech
# debt).
