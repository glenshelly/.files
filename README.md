# .files

## plans/thoughts

The start of my dotfiles. Current organizational plan is to have a .files folder in ~ containing my dotfiles with version control through git then to symlink these files to ~ for them to be read by appropriate programs. Current plans are to have dotfiles for vim, zsh and tmux then expand from there. And now my journey down the rabbit hole begins.
