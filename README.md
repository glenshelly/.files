# .files

My personal dotfiles.

Primarily a [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), [`zsh`](https://www.zsh.org) & [`neovim`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) workflow. See the respective topic folders: [`tmux`](./tmux), [`zsh`](./zsh) & [`neovim`](./neovim).

## getting started

Clone this repo (I clone it to `~/.files`) then run the setup script: [`<path-to-repo>/setup/install_dotfiles`](./setup/install_dotfiles). This script will walk through installing various shell utilities, applications and symlinking various files to their appropriate locations. See [`setup/bin`](./setup/bin/) folder for documentation on the setup process.
